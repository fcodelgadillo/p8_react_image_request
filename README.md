# p8_react_image_request
A react project to make api requests to get some images and add them a little style

the primary objective of this project is not to make a fancy looking app, but to create some components
in react and make them interact. The principal one is a class-based component since one as a JS developer should
know to use Hooks in combination with class components. One may think that every project works with the most advance
and modern react features, but this is not always true. We should be ready rewrite components from class-based to functional style.
